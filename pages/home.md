## Powered by Artificial Intelligence

Plastilinn utilizes a custom GPT-powered chatbot that helps generate your business plan with creative product or service ideas by exploring various angles and perspectives.

By integrating all business model components into a unified system, it becomes easier to update, maintain, and visualize your business model from different perspectives.
