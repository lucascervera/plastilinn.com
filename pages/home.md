## Powered by Artificial Intelligence

plastilinn’s uses a custom GPT chatbot that helps you generate creative product or service ideas, exploring various angles and perspectives. It offers guidance on completing your business model, including aspects such as market analysis, marketing strategies, financial planning, organizational structure, understanding market trends, analyzing customer demographics, and evaluating competitor behavior.

## Centralized information

plastilinn centralizes your business model information in a single place, avoiding data dispersion across multiple files on your hard drive (a PowerPoint with your Business Model Canvas, a PDF with your Value Proposition Canvas, an Excel file with your competitive analysis), making it easy to update, maintain, and visualize the components of the business model from different angles.

## Methodology and tools

plastilinn is based on popular innovation methodologies and tools, such as Lean Startup, Customer Development, and Design Thinking, integrating them and avoiding overlaps. Additionally, it provides the information you need at each moment to follow the process of creating your business model. It facilitates the complete cycle of design, analysis, and validation of your business model systematically and dynamically. It also provides reference content. For example, when you need to identify the channels that you will use to reach your customers, it provides an extensive list for you to incorporate into your business model without starting from scratch.
