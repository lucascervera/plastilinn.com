## 💰Revenue

💰#revenue T-Shirt Sales

Direct revenue generated from t-shirt sales through the e-commerce store, comprising the primary income stream.

💰#revenue Bulk Orders

Additional income generated by fulfilling bulk orders from institutions and organizations.

💰#revenue Secondary Merchandise

Potential expansion into additional merchandise like mugs or educational kits that align with science themes.

## 📄Life Time Value

Calculating the average customer lifetime value requires estimating the average order value, repeat purchase rates, and customer retention:

1. **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Estimated at $30
2. **Average Purchase Frequency**: Assuming customers purchase twice each year.
3. **Average Customer Lifespan**: Assuming active customers for 5 years.

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) = AOV x Purchase Frequency x Customer Lifespan = $30 x 2 x 5 = $300.

## 💸Costs

💸#cost Product Manufacturing Costs

Costs incurred to produce t-shirts, including materials and labor.

💸#cost Marketing Expenses

Budget dedicated to marketing and advertising campaigns across various platforms.

💸#cost Shipping Costs

Expenses related to shipping products to customers, including packaging and carrier fees.

💸#cost Website Maintenance

Ongoing costs for maintaining the e-commerce platform, including hosting and development.

💸#cost Customer Service Operations

Expenses related to providing quality customer service and support teams.

## 📄Customer Acquisition Cost

Calculating customer acquisition cost (CAC) involves assessing marketing expenses against the number of new customers acquired during a specified timeframe.

**CAC Calculation:**
- Total Marketing Expenses: $20,000
- New Customers Acquired: 1,000

CAC = Total Marketing Expenses / Number of New Customers Acquired = $20,000 / 1,000 = $20.

## 📄Unit economics

Unit economics for t-shirt sales involve analyzing the revenue and costs associated with a single t-shirt sold.

**Revenue per T-Shirt**: Estimated at $30 

**Cost per T-Shirt**: Estimated production cost of $15

**Profit per T-Shirt**: $30 - $15 = $15 

**Margin**: Profit / Revenue = $15 / $30 = 50%.

## 💵Funding sources

Funding sources may include personal investment, small business loans, crowdfunding campaigns focused on science-themed projects, and potential base financial contributions from grants promoting educational initiatives.
