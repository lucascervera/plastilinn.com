**Customer Lifespan**  
Assuming an average customer lifespan of 5 years.

### 📄Customer Acquisition Cost

To calculate the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for the ghostbusters business, consider the following expenses related to acquiring new customers.

**Scenario**: The business invests in marketing, promotions, and community events to attract customers.

1. **Marketing Campaigns**: $3,000
2. **Promotional Materials**: $1,500
3. **Community Event Participation**: $2,000
4. **Staff Time for Marketing Efforts**: $1,500

**Total Acquisition Cost**: Total Acquisition Cost = $3,000 + $1,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $8,000

**Number of New Customers Acquired**: Assuming 200 new customers acquired from these efforts.

**Calculation of CAC**:  
CAC = Total Acquisition Cost / Number of New Customers Acquired  
CAC = $8,000 / 200 = $40

### 📄Unit economics

Calculating the unit economics of a typical ghost tour service involves understanding the revenue and costs associated with each tour, highlighting profitability.

**Revenue per Tour**:  
Assuming an average ticket price of $40 and 15 attendees per tour.

2. **Equipment Costs**: $50  
3. **Marketing Cost per Tour**: $30  
4. **Venue Fees**: $50  
5. **Miscellaneous Costs**: $20  

**Total Cost per Tour**: $100 + $50 + $30 + $50 + $20 = $250  

**Profit per Tour**:  
Profit = Revenue - Total Cost  
Profit = $600 - $250 = $350  

**Margin per Tour**:  
Margin = Profit / Revenue  
Margin = $350 / $600 ≈ 58.33%
