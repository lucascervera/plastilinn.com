2. **Promotional Materials**: $1,500
3. **Community Event Participation**: $2,000
4. **Staff Time for Marketing Efforts**: $1,500

**Number of New Customers Acquired**: Assuming 200 new customers acquired from these efforts.

**Calculation of CAC**:  
CAC = Total Acquisition Cost / Number of New Customers Acquired  
CAC = $8,000 / 200 = $40

### üìÑUnit economics

Calculating the unit economics of a typical ghost tour service involves understanding the revenue and costs associated with each tour, highlighting profitability.

**Revenue per Tour**:  
Assuming an average ticket price of $40 and 15 attendees per tour.

1. **Guide Payment**: $100  
2. **Equipment Costs**: $50  
3. **Marketing Cost per Tour**: $30  
4. **Venue Fees**: $50
